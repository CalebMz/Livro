In today's day and age with us all being confined to our homes books have become more than just stories but rather portals to new and exciting worlds, an escape from today's uncertainty. But what's more important than finding a book? Finding the right book. This is where Livro comes in. As someone who loves reading themselves, I know just how important it is to pick a book or series of novels that you are going to enjoy. There is nothing worse then buying a book and realizing half way through that it isn't for you.    
Livro is meant to help ease the search by recommending users trending books while also allowing them to find reviews for the book they are interested in all in one app. 
The display for Livro is simple and straight to the point, it wants to show you what's good quickly so you can use the Goodreads website to find the books reviews, so that's what it does.
The welcome page, home page and logo where designed specifically for the app.
