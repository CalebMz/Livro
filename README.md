# Livro
Uses react-native and does not use any os specific code so the code is meant to run the same on all platforms.
The project can be found on the expo app or web page by clicking on this link: https://exp.host/@calebmz/Livro. 
The aim of this project was to help readers. As someone who loves reading themselves, I know just how important is to pick a book or series of novels 
that you are going to enjoy. There is nothing worse then buying a book and realizing half way through that it isn't for you. Livro is meant to help ease the search 
by recommending users trending books while also allowing them to find reviews for the book they are interested in all in one app. The display for Livro is simple and 
straight to the point, it wants to show you whats good quickly so you can use the Goodreads website to find the books reviews so that's what it does.
The welcome page, home page and logo where designed specifically for the app.
